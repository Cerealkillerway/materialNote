// task: avoid image popover disappearing
it's materialnote.change event triggered by editor.afterCommand function through context.triggerEvent
that forces handle to update (handle controls also the popover visibility) base/module/Handle.js row 17

- when clicking float button (left or right or none) the event materialnote.change is fired twice; need to track down the second call...
